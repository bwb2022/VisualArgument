My visual argument is bringing awareness to mental health, and the struggles that some people go through. This visual argument includes the word “Ask” which is telling the viewer to not stand by and watch. If someone does not want to be alone, they should not need to be or feel alone. I plan to put a small single person in the bottom right corner. Therefore, the entire thing will be telling the viewer to be there for someone who otherwise may be alone.
